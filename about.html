									<h1>I'm<br />
									Andrew Holmes</h1>
									<p>I'm a senior studying mechanical engineering at Olin College,<br />
									a project-based engineering school that emphasizes teaming experiences<br />
									and an engineering that starts and ends with people.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/about/andrewholmes1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I've spent my time at Olin honing my mechanical design skills and designing for a diverse range of people including older adults, people who use wheelchairs, factory workers at a textile mill, and professional endoscopists. I got my start as an engineer at my middle school in Winchester, MA with the help and support of my engineering/technology teachers. In high school, we worked to build a new 3D printer for the school and a new framework for using 3D printers in the classroom. Upon taking a course in social entrepreneurship called Youth CITIES, I realized the potential for engineers to make a difference and have real impact. Olin was the perfect place for my newfound entrepreneurial spirit and excitement for engineering. Although I was shy throughout most of my childhood, these experiences helped me to build my self-confidence and tap into my creativity.</p>
								<p>At Olin I've found myself engaged in acessibility projects that make it easier for people to interact with their environment, and I've been willing to challenge myself in new, potentially daunting experiences, helping dancers in wheelchairs make a statement about accessibility in the built environment, and working directly with an older adult to make her shopping experience in her wheelchair less taxing. Both of these projects and many others in my portfolio have evolved from classes into pure passion projects. Outside of classes you can find me working on the Baja team's offroad racing vehicle, fixing up an old 1980s Mercedes with my friends for a 24 hour endurance race, or nerding out about all things Nintendo.</p>
								<p>I encourage you to take a look at the individual pages for each project I have worked on, and if you would like, you can contact me through the email or phone number listed on my <a href="HolmesResume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
