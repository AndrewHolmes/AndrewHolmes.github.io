							<h1>Aeroponic Growing System</h1>
							<center><span class="image"><img src="images/aeroponicfinal.jpg" alt="" /></span></center>
							<p>The aeroponic growing system was my team's final project for Olin's Principle of Engineering (POE) class. The goal was to create an <b>integrated system</b> with an electrical, mechanical, and software component to learn how to work on <b>inter-disciplinary teams</b>. My team consisted of two mechanical engineers (of which I was one), two software engineers, and one electrical engineer. We structured the project around four two-week long <b>sprint cycles</b> in which we aimed to tackle a critical piece of functionality during each sprint. During POE I also developed skills <b>programming with Arduino</b>, designing with <b>Solidworks</b>, <b>configuring electrical hardware components</b>, and practicing <b>project scoping</b>.</p>

							<p>Aeroponics is a method of watering plants that does not use soil. Nutrient filled water sprays directly at the roots of suspended plants. Our system was designed to hold three plants above the central basin of nutrient filled water. The plants are mounted on a rotating table that transports each plant to the mister. Excess water is sent back through a funnel and into the basin. A lighting system is mounted above the plants to simulate sunlight. We created a web app (find our code <a  href="https://github.com/marches/Aeroponics">here </a>) that can control when and how much the plants are watered, while also reminding the user when to refill the basin.</p>

							<p>In the first sprint we aimed to develop an understanding of how the primary hardware in our system would work, sourcing a pump and water level sensor that could be controlled through an Arduino. Together we learned how to use the pump, mount it, connect the proper tubing, and I quickly created a rig that we could use to hold water bucket, pump, and water level sensor. We soon realized that creating a project centered around the flow and control of water was going to further complicate our task of integrating all three subsystems, and began thinking more about how water would flow from the source to the plants without interfering with electrical components.</p>

							<p>In the second sprint we decided on the concept of a vertically stacked structure with a basin of water at the bottom. This would allow us to mount the electronics in a separate compartment and keep the water contained. The plants could then sit on top of the structure where they could easily be accessed. We also decided on the concept of a rotating table during the sprint. A rotating table would allow us to route only one stream of water and have the plants come to the water instead of having their own dedicated mister. Using laser cut pieces of hardboard and a servo, we created a rig with a rotating table on top and a bucket of water connected to the pump on the bottom, however we still were not ready to run the system with water yet.</p>

							<p>Sprint 3 had us playing with the configuration of more hardware components and attempting to start running tests of the system with water. We decided to settle with the idea of a system that could be inserted into a bucket so that we could quickly run tests with water and not make a huge mess. After designing the components in Solidworks, we configured the system and quickly realized that it was very challenging to connect all the components as we had intended, and water leaking onto the electrical components became an issue.</p>

							<p>With Sprint 4 the project came to a conclusion and we landed on our final design. We finally implemented a funnel and mister head so that water could be targeted at the plants and sent back into the basin. All of the sensors were configured and working properly (we routed them to a separate compartment that sits at the base of the system). While still largely created from laser cut materials, we moved away from hard board to acrylic that would play better with water. The rotating table was successful in transporting the plants to and from the mister when they needed to be watered. Water traveled through the funnel and into a tube at the center of the system, avoiding contact with the servo that controlled the rotation of the table.</p>

							<p>Overall, the project was a great opportunity to practice implementing electronics, software, and water into the mechanical design of a system, but I am not as happy with the overall polish of the system or the overall design as I would have hoped. It was a challenge to find an elegant system that would keep electronics and water separate without being overly complicated. A real sticking point was the routing of electronic components that needed to go inside the basin of water, such as the pump and nutrient sensor. One of the biggest lessons of the project for me was the importance of designing a system that can easily be troubleshooted. It often required that we disassemble much of the system in order to make one small change. We also realized just how important communication is between subsystems. At one point our electrical lead purhcased a nutirent drip system that was not going to fit in the system we designed, and we had to source a new one. We also could have been better about communicating how wires would be routed from the very beginning instead of struggling to route them at the end. Finally, the experience proved to be a lesson in how to properly scope a project. While we felt comfortable during the project with the milestones we were hitting, we realized that they were not ambitious enough to make the final execution of the project as polished as we had anticipated. More planning toward the start of the project and a better group understanding would have lead to faster execution of the final fabrication.</p>
