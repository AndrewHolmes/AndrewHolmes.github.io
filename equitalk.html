							<p>Equitalk is a concept for an IOT discourse analysis tool that shows participants how much they are talking, displaying the information as colored segments around a ring. Each segment corresponds to an individual, encouraging participants to adjust their input and give others a chance to speak. Additional data captured through sentiment analysis can be viewed in post via a companion app. The project evolved from a course in collaboration with Olin, Babson, and Mass Art called Integrated Product Design. I worked with two Babson business students, an Olin engineer in human factors design, and a Mass Art industrial designer. Over the course of this project I developed skills in <b>electronic prototyping</b>, <b>business plan development</b>, <b>user interviews and research</b>, and <b>3D rendering</b>, in addition to creating business pitches and <b>working with non-engineering disciplines</b>.</p>

							<p>The design process my team developed consisted of three phases, each lasting three-four weeks. The course tasked us with developing an IOT product that had something to do with the theme of encouraging "inclusive communities." For the first phase we began by defining our team values and determining what "inclusive communities" really meant to us. We decided we wanted to create something that promoted equity, not equality, something that would give the underdogs an opportunity for their voice to be heard. We conducted preliminary user research and spoke with different people to decide on three potential user groups: people with anxiety, manual laborers, and child therapists. We settled on child therapists, hypothesizing that we could find a solution that would allow for children in therapy to better express their point of view.</p>

							<p></p>

							<p>In phase two we began to ideate and brainstorm ideas that would solve the problem we started to define in the first phase. At the end of our brainstorming session we went through our ideas to classify them as both useful and data-based. The "useful data" framework helped us to narrow our ideas into a space that would tackle the problem and have an IOT spin. After brainstorming, we landed on several potential ideas including an art board/scanner that would encourage children to express their emotions, and what would eventually become Equitalk. We spoke with child therapists from several institutions and people who had gone through therapy as children to gather feedback on the ideas and better define our problem statement. One former child we spoke with described their experience to us, stating:</p>

							<blockquote><p>I was using the words other people used about me because they were the only words I had to describe myself… it’s so easy to take what an adult says to you as an immutable truth rather than just something they’re saying.</p></blockquote>

							<p>Similar sentiment was echoed throughout our interviews, that children can struggle to articulate their ideas, accepting the adult's word instead of providing their own. With my background in discourse analysis research at Olin, we felt confident that we could develop a device that would monitor and analyze group conversations in order to solve the problem we encountered.</p>

							<p></p>

							<p>In phase three we worked at a rapid fire pace to develop a first pass working prototype, come up with a business plan, and flesh out the functionality and presentation of the idea with sketches and renders from our industrial designer. Myself and the other Olin student designed a functional prototype that would proportionally adjust the percentage of light shining for a given person based on how much they were speaking. I also created a sentiment analysis program in Python that could quantify how objective/subjective or positive/negative an individual was, but did not have time to integrate it with the core prototype, instead creating individual buttons that participants could hold down while speaking to represent their involvement in the conversation. The form of the device was intentionally designed to look like a donut, its round shape and concave central dome allowing participants to see the status of the display from any angle. We continued to flesh out the versatility of the product, recognizing that the idea could also be applied in other settings, such as in student teams and business meetings.</p>

							<p>Over the course of a few months, my team had managed to start with nothing, select a user group to research, define a problem, brainstorm a solution, test it with users, prototype it, and develop a clear vision for what it does and how it would be marketed. While I was the engineer on the team, I also got to be heavily involved in the product direction and design decisions, and working with students in other disciplines gave me the opportunity to learn more about how to pitch a product, create elegant mockups and renderings, and tie it together with my other engineering and design experience from Olin. I am more comfortable now collaborating with other people, regardless of their major, and seeing a project through from start to finish.</p>
